          <h2>Java Collection Classes for Parallel, Distributed and on-Disk Computations</h2>
          <hr>
        <h3>What is PDQCollection?</h3>
        <p>PDQCollection are Java collection classes (<code>Map</code>, <code>Set</code>, etc.) that are specially designed for parallel and distributed data-intensive programming.</p>
        
        <p>PDQCollection is a unique programming model that: (a) operates on associative containers, (b) executes in shared-memory parallel mode as well as distributed, (c) supports data sizes that scale from in-memory to disk-backed, and (d) allows developing parallel/distributed programs in the natural sequential and object-oriented style of programming. </p>
       

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

<p>The key insight to PDQCollection is the <em>Split-Replication-Merge</em> computation model. The input is first <em>splitted</em> into smaller problems and the output is <em>replicated</em> into containers to hold partial results. Parallel or distributed threads compute your function for each pair of partial input and partial output. The partial results are then <em>merged</em> to the final output. <!--See <a href="mastering_the_concepts.html">Mastering the Concepts</a> for further details.</p>-->

<p>The second insight is that the parallelism is "built in" into the data structures, rather than scattered over your computation code. As a programmer, you only need to define how two values are to be added, and the library will take care of the rest. See the <a href="word_count_example.html">Word Count example</a> for this concept in action.</p>

<p>

<h3>Is it any good?</h3>

<p>Oh, we'll say! And here's why:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>PDQCollection does not use locks, ever!</b> </li>
Concurrent data structures (e.g. <code>ConcurrentHashMap</code>) use locks to protect concurrent modifications. For data-intensive problems, these locks are contests so often that the performance with multiple threads turns out to be actually poorer than sequential! 
<li><b>PDQCollection does not cache data.</b></li>
Disk-backed structures are two-tiered: in-memory cache and on-disk B-tree. The cache miss penalty increases as the cache ratio gets smaller. PDQCollection library, however, reads and writes to disk only once, and does not require caches. By avoiding caching and random disk accesses, the PDQCollection classes significantly outperforms traditional disk-backed data structures.
<li><b>PDQCollection does not randomly seek data on disk or remote machines.</b></li>
PDQCollection classes always access the out-of-core data (on disk or remote machine) as a sequential stream of bytes, for reading and writing.
</ul>

<p>Please refer to the <a href="http://fmdb.cs.ucla.edu/Treports/PDQCollections%20Paper.pdf">Technical Report</a> for detailed performance analysis with concurrent data structures, BerkeleyDB and Hazelcast distributed map.</p>

<h3>Where can it be used?</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://fmdb.cs.ucla.edu/Treports/PDQCollections%20Paper.pdf">Technical Report</a> gives several examples to illustrate the capabilities of PDQCollections library with several applications drawn from a variety of fields in Computer Science, including</p>

<ul>
    <li>Machine Learning (see the KMeans example for clustering)</li>
    <li>Data Mining (see the FP Growth example for frequent itemset discovery)</li>
    <li>Graph Processing (see the Pagerank example)</li>
    <li>Relational processing of structured data</li>
    <li>Incremental processing of log data</li>
</ul>
